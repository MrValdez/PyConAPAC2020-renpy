# This is the repository for my talk that I gave at PyCon APAC 2020.

The directories are as follows:

**PyCon APAC 2020 - presentation** contains the ren'py source code for my presentation.

**PyCon APAC 2020 live** contains the source code of the live coding done during the talk.

**live coding images** is just a directory for my convenience to allow me to copy-paste the images during live coding.

## Favorite ren'py game

I can't believe I couldn't remember the name of my favorite ren'py games, during the presentation. They are: 

* **Long Live The Queen** - A simulation type game where you have to raise the princess to be a queen. Unfortunately, everyone is out to... claim the crown for themselves.

* **Doki Doki Literature Club!** - A psychological horror game.
